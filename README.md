I chose the question of whether respondents find seat reclining rude because I was personally interested in how others feel about this action. I was interested to find that there was a decently large amount of respondents who consider it somewhat rude, which is higher than I anticipated. The bar chart shows that the highest number of respondents of 500 don't think it is rude, followed by 300 who think it is somewhat rude, and finally a small proportion of 100 think it is very rude.
